# Streetpass On Citra
Program built for extracting CECD savedata files in a more user friendly way, and allows for almost automatic Streetpassing on Citra. <br> <br>

# Usage 
Opening a command prompt in the same location as the application and running `cecd_citra -h` will show the commands available to use. <br> <br>
For the ability to Streetpass, `citra_path` has to be set by either running `-set_path` or by manually typing your path in `config.yaml` <br> <br> 
`config.yaml` has to be present in the current directory for the application to run, if it is not present it will error out. This is so paths and other misc settings can be saved.

# *Note*
This program is a temporary soloution for Streetpassing on Citra. <br> <br> *This will be obsolete once an open source implementation of Streetpassing has been implemented in mainline Citra builds.*
